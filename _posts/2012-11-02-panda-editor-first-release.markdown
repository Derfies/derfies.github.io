It's been just over a year since I started the editor project and I've finally got around to making a release. "Release early, release often" as they say – I seem to be struggling with both those concepts. I've found it difficult to shelve the idea of not releasing a polished piece of code in order to get some feedback, so I've pared some of the features which were still in early development and moved some of the other functionality into plugins that I will release later. In this way I hope to create a nice, solid core which can be expanded with plugins. Hopefully some other users will find it useful!

Code is available [here](https://github.com/Derfies/panda3d-editor).
