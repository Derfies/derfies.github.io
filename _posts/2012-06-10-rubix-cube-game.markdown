I’ve just uploaded my latest Panda3D project which you can play [here](http://kurohyou.p3dp.com/rubixCube.html) – it’s a small Rubix Cube simulation. This was my first project to be completed with the editor I’m developing. It’s quite simple in scope but was valuable as an exercise as it dictated which features I added to the editor next. Needless to say developing an editor and a project with it in parallel is pretty exhausting!

Here’s a screenshot of how the editor looks in its current state with the Rubix Cube project loaded:

More details on the editor in my next post.
