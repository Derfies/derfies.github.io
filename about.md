Hello! Iâ€™m James Davies, am a passionate Senior Technical Artist who has been working in the video game industry for eight years; working on such titles as L.A. Noire, de Blob 2 and Marvel Super Hero Squad on such platforms as PS3, Xbox360 and Wii.

I am particularly interested in the technical aspects of game development and enjoy designing pipelines and tool development. I have a lot of experience in scripting for 3ds Max, Maya and Photoshop using languages such as Mel, Maxscript, Python, Javascript, C# and CG. I also have experience in creating applications for mobile devices using the Unity engine.
